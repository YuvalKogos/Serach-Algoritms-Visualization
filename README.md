# Search-Algoritms-Visualization
Making a visualization for famous search algorithms from scratch in Python (without external libraries),
In goal of get full understanding of those algorithms.

At the source.py there is implementation of A star and Dijkstra's. 
At the begining of the file (after the import section) you can find a boolean called A star which choose which algorithm will be used.
If True - A star, If false - Dijkstra's.
